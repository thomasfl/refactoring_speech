Refactoring speech
==================

Implications of refactoring and code smells.

# Questions asked

We all know ugly program code is bad. When readability gets worse, the time
used on maintainenance goes up, the number defects goes up and
more importantly developers get pissed off by having to work on

But all code smells can't be eqully important? Is there a way to
accurately measure the implications of the different code smells so
we can know wich ones are important and which ones are not?

After all Martin Fowler's book on Refactoring only gives you a list
of code smells and tells you have to clean up your code. He and
others still only has a "hunch" regarding which ones are important.


# Method

What if you hire 6 different programmers working offline, give them a
set of programming tasks, log every tap on their keyboard and every mouseclick
from within their IDE. Then analyse the source repository
with tools that recognises code smells (Borland Together and InCode).
After half a year you end up with massive amounts of data.

At the Simular research lab they needed to rewrite a web based system
for keeping track of projects, experiments and people. This occasion
was used to conduct an experiment.

Another research project at the Simula Research had finished measuring
the skill levels of 200 programmers. Out of those 200 people, 6 developers
from Poland and the Check republic with approximately similar skill levels were
selected. During the 6 months the project lasted, they were
visited and interviewed face to face
